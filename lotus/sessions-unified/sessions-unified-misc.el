  ;; 39.17 Session Management

  ;; Emacs supports the X Session Management Protocol, which is used
  ;; to suspend and restart applications. In the X Window System, a
  ;; program called the session manager is responsible for keeping
  ;; track of the applications that are running. When the X server
  ;; shuts down, the session manager asks applications to save their
  ;; state, and delays the actual shutdown until they respond. An
  ;; application can also cancel the shutdown.

  ;; When the session manager restarts a suspended session, it directs
  ;; these applications to individually reload their saved state. It
  ;; does this by specifying a special command-line argument that says
  ;; what saved session to restore. For Emacs, this argument is
  ;; ‘--smid session’.  — Variable: emacs-save-session-functions

  ;; Emacs supports saving state via a hook called
  ;; emacs-save-session-functions. Emacs runs this hook when the
  ;; session manager tells it that the window system is shutting
  ;; down. The functions are called with no arguments, and with the
  ;; current buffer set to a temporary buffer. Each function can use
  ;; insert to add Lisp code to this buffer. At the end, Emacs saves
  ;; the buffer in a file, called the session file.

  ;; Subsequently, when the session manager restarts Emacs, it loads
  ;; the session file automatically (see Loading). This is performed
  ;; by a function named emacs-session-restore, which is called during
  ;; startup. See Startup Summary.

  ;; If a function in emacs-save-session-functions returns non-nil,
  ;; Emacs tells the session manager to cancel the shutdown.

  ;; Here is an example that just inserts some text into *scratch*
  ;; when Emacs is restarted by the session manager.

  ;; (add-hook 'emacs-save-session-functions 'save-yourself-test)

  (defun save-yourself-test ()
    (insert "(save-current-buffer
       (switch-to-buffer \"*scratch*\")
       (insert \"I am restored\"))")
    nil))
