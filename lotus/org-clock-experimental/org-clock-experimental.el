;;How about a function for adding subtasks? This one adds a deadline to the
;;subtask if its parent has one:

(defun my-org-insert-sub-task ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((parent-deadline (org-get-deadline-time nil)))
    (org-goto-sibling)
    (org-insert-todo-subheading t)
    (when parent-deadline
      (org-deadline nil parent-deadline))))

;; Don't forget to bind it to a key:

;; (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c s") 'my-org-insert-sub-task)

;; Also you might find these settings useful:

(setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
(setq org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks 'invisible)

;; The following command inserts the typical org logbook entry, a time range
;; starting from N minutes ago:

(defun org-insert-clock-range (&optional n)
  (interactive "NTime Offset (in min): ")
  (let* ((ctime (cl-rest (decode-time (current-time))))
         (min (cl-first ctime))
         (start (apply 'encode-time 0 (- min n) (cl-rest ctime))))
    (org-insert-time-stamp start t t "CLOCK: ")
    (insert "--")
    (org-insert-time-stamp (current-time) t t)))




;; mutbuerger's answer helped me a lot. It's my first time programming in elisp
;; other than configuration. His answer was close to the mark, but I still
;; wanted the normal functionality of clock-in and clock-out for finding or
;; creating the logbook under the closest heading, and adding a note.

;; My amended solution was this:

(defun offset-current-time (n)
  (let* ((ctime (cl-rest (decode-time (current-time))))
         (minutes (cl-first ctime)))
    (apply 'encode-time 0 (- minutes n) (cl-rest ctime))))

(defun org-insert-clock-range (&optional n)
  (interactive "NTime Offset (in min): ")
  (org-clock-in nil (offset-current-time n))
  (org-clock-out))

(defadvice org-clock-out (after org-clock-out-after activate)
  (ignore-errors                        ;for now
   (when nil (org-update-all-dblocks))))
