and for reminder also deadline/schedule timestamp helps.

Here is how to remember to clock-in and to clock-in to correct clock when
working on some projects where many time one need to hop between different

Then a dynamic, contextual suggestion based clock management with minimum user
attention might fill above scenario, org context clock try to address this, by


- Frequently presenting tasks selection popup based on current context to clock-in
- Also do clock in to unnamed task if no specific selected task for clocking in
