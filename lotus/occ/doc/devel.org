* Code here may be the hell of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection][indirection]], but still helping in one way


  
* Naming convention
** Naming generi function

   for accessor or nouns

   using prefix "occ-obj-"

   for verb

   using prefix "occ-do-"

** Naming for ordinary function

   for launcher or runner

   could use prefix "occ-run-"

   


  
  
* To reduce number of params like (or this that else that)

  using

  #+begin_src elisp
    (cl-defmethod OCC-OBJ-MARKER ((mrk marker))
      mrk)
    (cl-defmethod OCC-OBJ-MARKER ((obj OCC-TSK))
      (OCC-TSK-MARKER obj)
  #+end_src  


  This will cover MARKER and OCC-TSK and its subclassed.

  This is reducing code size by reducing number of parameters to functions like #'OR


  Yes this requires number of accessors methods.
  
  
* Not run ahead
  Mean do not code base and advanced feature together
  first complete base feature, when it is working then only
  go for advanced feature.
