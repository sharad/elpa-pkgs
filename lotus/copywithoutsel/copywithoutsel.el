;; Introduction

;; The following functions will copy the word, the line, the
;; paragraph and the string and the Parenthesis at point, and will
;; paste them to the mark. If it is used in shell-mode, stuff will
;; be pasted at end of shell prompt.

;; Give a prefix 1 will prevent paste.

;; And besides, there are also something to do with some basic
;; shortcuts.  Selecting words or sexps without moving the cursor

;; You can select word or sexp after point and put it in the
;; kill-ring by typing:

;;          C-M-SPC M-w

;; This does not move the cursor. If you want to select the next two
;; words after point, just type C-M-SPC C-M-SPC M-w. Killing next
;; word or sexp can be done with C-M-SPC C-w, or better with C-M-k.
;; the base functions

;; Tip: WholeLineOrRegion copies the current line when the region is
;; not active. Thus, C-a M-w C-y C-y … duplicates the current
