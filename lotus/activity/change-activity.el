;;; Commentary:

;; This package meant to log, analyze and report all emacs change-activity of
;; user which could further utilized to visualize change-activity of user
;; during period of time or editing session.

;; Enable Change-Activity for the current buffer by invoking
;; `change-activity-mode'. If you wish to activate it globally, use
;; `global-change-activity-mode'.

;; Set variable `change-activity-api-key' to your API key. Point
;; `change-activity-cli-path' to the absolute path of the CLI script
;; (change-activity-cli.py).
