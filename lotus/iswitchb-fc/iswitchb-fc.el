;; iswitchb-fc: Integrate file-cache with iswitchb

;; http://tao.uab.es/cgi-bin/archzoom.cgi/jao@gnu.org--2004/unix--emacs--0--patch-23/other/iswitchb-fc.el?download

;; That site seems no longer to be available (2012-07-23). This seems to work: https://github.com/emacsmirror/iswitchb-fc/blob/master/iswitchb-fc.el – DrewAdams

;; I think iswitchb-fc is awesome!! – Anonymous

;; patch to integrate find-file – rubikitch
;; Using iswitchb to open files from file name cache -- take two

;; Filecache rules but I did not like the way it completes the file names. Iswitchb-fc above is a really cool enhancement to filecache but I did not like that it was integrated with ‘C-x b’ (I guess I want to know what files I actually have open). Hence this little hack:

(defun file-cache-iswitchb-file ()
  "Using iswitchb, interactively open file from file cache'.
First select a file, matched using iswitchb against the contents
in `file-cache-alist'. If the file exist in more than one
directory, select directory. Lastly the file is opened."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((file (file-cache-iswitchb-read "File: "
                                         (mapcar
                                          (lambda (x)
                                            (cl-first x))
                                          file-cache-alist)))
         (record (assoc file file-cache-alist)))
    (find-file
     (concat
      (if (= (length record) 2)
          (cl-first (cl-rest record))
          (file-cache-iswitchb-read
           (format "Find %s in dir: " file) (cl-rest record))) file))))

(defun file-cache-iswitchb-read (prompt choices)
  (let ((iswitchb-make-buflist-hook
         (lambda ()
           (setq iswitchb-temp-buflist choices))))
    (iswitchb-read-buffer prompt)))

;; I bind ‘C-c f’ to it:

;; (global-set-key "\C-cf" 'file-cache-iswitchb-file)

;; Happy happy, joy joy! – MaDa
