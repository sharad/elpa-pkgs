;; Emacs Database Mode | A New Emacs Mode For Working With Databases
;; Emacs is a text editor, but more than that, it is a framework that
;; enables you to develop applications that can manipulate text in a
;; variety of ways. For example, when I am working with databases, I
;; want to create queries and send them to the database. I'll need a
;; text editor to create the query in the first place so it makes
;; sense that should add functionality to emacs that can easily send
;; my query straight to the database.

;; Let me demonstrate with a fairly substantial example that mimics
;; typical usage of comint mode. Normally comint is used for
;; interacting with an interpreter. I do a lot of database work with
;; Sybase so a new emacs mode that helped with that would be
;; great. Adapting this for other databases should be fairly
;; straightforward.

;; I can leverage off the useful sql-mode that already provides syntax
;; highlighting and database interaction. However, as far as I know,
;; it doesn't really help me with my favourite usage style where I
;; have a command window containing my queries and a separate results
;; window.

;; When you have finished looking at this lens, have a look at the
;; db-mode extension for working with multiple databases.  Contents at
;; a Glance

;; Ugly Results Without Filtering
;; Emacs will be connecting to the stdin and stdout of isql, but the problem is that when we send a query to isql, it doesn't echo back what the query was. For example:

;; echo 'select *
;;   from person
;; where surname = "Doe"' | isql


;; gives the following output

;; 1> 2> 3> name surname
;; ---- -------
;; John Doe

;; (1 row affected)
;; Required (prettier) Result
;; I think those prompts 1> 2> 3> look ugly so I want to remove them and I also want to echo the query before the results.

;; select *
;;   from person
;;  where surname = "Doe"

;; name surname
;; ---- -------
;; John Doe

;; (1 row affected)
;; Adding The Filter
;; To remove the prompts we add a simple filter to comint-preoutput-filter-functions.

(defconst db-re-isql-prompt (concat "^ *"
                                    "\\([0-9]+> +\\)"

;; Adding Quote Words Syntax
;; Because I am controlling all of the input that isql sees, I can add some new syntax. I often do a lot of WHERE field in ("val1", "val2", ...) type queries and it is annoying to add all the quotes and commas. Wouldn't it be nice if I had something similar to qw(...) syntax in perl?

;; HowTo Query Multiple Databases With Emacs Db Mode
;; Set The Database Parameters
;; Let me remind you how we set the database parameters using db-set-params.

(defvar db-server "")
(defvar db-database "")
(defvar db-user "")
(defvar db-password "")

(defun db-set-params (server database user password)
  (setq db-server server
        db-database database
        db-user user
        db-password password))
;; Database Static Data
;; Right - so in my company we have a bunch of databases that store client order details. Each region has its own orders database and there are two user accounts that I generally use - one for querying the database (restricted) and the other for updating the data (admin).

;; Okay, so the first thing we need is something that maps short aliases to database details - server, database, user and password. I'll store the details in a vector.

;; Let's say (for the purposes of the example) that all of the accounts have the same password :)

(defconst ro-pwd "********")
(defconst rw-pwd "********")

(defun _db-one-info (region server user password)
  (cons region (vector server "orders" user password)))
;; The Admin and Restricted Users
;; We have a convenience function for creating the restricted and admin users.

(defun _db-region-info (region p-server q-server)
  (list (_db-one-info (concat region "-ro") p-server "restricted" ro-pwd)
        (_db-one-info (concat region "-rw") p-server "admin" rw-pwd)))
;; Creating The Database Aliases
;; Then we create the aliases for London, Frankfurt and Mexico and we filter out the aliases using mapcar.

(defconst *db-info*
  (append (_db-region-info "ldn" "LDN_ORDERS_DB" "LDN_ORDERS_QA")
          (_db-region-info "fft" "FFT_ORDERS_DB" "FFT_ORDERS_QA")
          (_db-region-info "mex" "MEX_ORDERS_DB" "MEX_ORDERS_QA")))

(defconst *db-valid-regions*
  (mapcar (lambda (e) (cl-first e)) *db-info*))

(defvar db-region "ldn-ro")
;; The Resultant Data
;; This is what the static data looks like (in the actual data there are more production databases and QA aswell):

;; (insert (format "%s" *db-info*))

;; ((ldn-ro . [LDN_ORDERS_DB orders restricted ********])
;;  (ldn-rw . [LDN_ORDERS_DB orders admin ********])
;;  (fft-ro . [FFT_ORDERS_DB orders restricted ********])
;;  (fft-rw . [FFT_ORDERS_DB orders admin ********])
;;  (mex-ro . [MEX_ORDERS_DB orders restricted ********])
;;  (mex-rw . [MEX_ORDERS_DB orders admin ********]))


;; Retrieving The Database Details
;; And finally (for the static data) we have helper functions to select each piece of data depending on the region.

(defsubst db-get-param (region ref)
  (let ((tuple (assoc region *db-info*)))

        (aref (cl-rest tuple) ref)

;;       (global-mode-string (-- global-mode-string)) -%-)


;; As you can see, it is a list with a bunch of variables, some function calls and some special codes beginning with or containing a %. For example -%- produces an infinite number of dashes. Almost all modelines have this as a terminator.

;; If you add a variable to the mode-line-format, updating the variable automatically updates the modeline.
;; The Mode Line Update Function
;; The first thing we need to do is see if the db-mode-string variable is part of the mode-line-format variable already using memq. If it is, we can just set it and force a mode-line-update. If not, we need to insert the variable before the final -%-.

(defun db-update-mode-line ()
