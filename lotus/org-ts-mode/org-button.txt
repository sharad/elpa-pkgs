Here is a clear, technical, Emacs-focused breakdown:
üöÄ Is it possible?

‚úÖ Yes, in Emacs Org-mode or any major mode, you can render a fixed pattern of text (e.g., encrypted text) as an actionable button that:

    visually replaces the text with a clickable button,

    on click, decrypts the data,

    copies the decrypted text to the clipboard.

You can achieve this using:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Org-mode link parameters (org-add-link-type) for Org mode.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Text property overlays with insert-button or make-button for any major mode.
ü©∂ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using Org-mode (org-add-link-type)
Example:

You can define a custom encrypted: link type:

(defun my/decrypt-and-copy-to-clipboard (encrypted-text)
  "Decrypt ENCRYPTED-TEXT and copy the result to the clipboard."
  (let ((decrypted-text
         ;; Replace this with your real decryption call
         (concat "[DECRYPTED] " encrypted-text)))
    (kill-new decrypted-text)
    (message "Decrypted text copied to clipboard.")))

(org-link-set-parameters
 "encrypted"
 :follow (lambda (path)
           (my/decrypt-and-copy-to-clipboard path))
 :display 'full)

Usage in Org file:

[[encrypted:U2FsdGVkX1+somethingencrypted][Click to decrypt]]

‚úÖ On pressing C-c C-o or clicking, it will:

    decrypt U2FsdGVkX1+somethingencrypted,

    copy the plaintext to your clipboard,

    show a confirmation in the minibuffer.

üö© If you want the display text to be replaced automatically in the Org buffer

Org-mode does not auto-replace link text with a button appearance by default.
For advanced rendering (like Spacemacs dashboard buttons), you can use:

    Org Babel with inline image replacement, or

    org-fontify overlays, or

    Using org-link-set-parameters :display with a custom function (Emacs 29+).

Example for visual replacement:

(org-link-set-parameters
 "encrypted"
 :display (lambda (path desc)
            (propertize (or desc "[üîí Encrypted: Click to Decrypt]")
                        'face '(:foreground "orange" :weight bold))))

ü©∂ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using overlays/buttons in any major mode

If you want this outside Org-mode (e.g., in text-mode, prog-mode, or a custom major mode), you can use:
Example:

(defun my/add-encrypted-button (start end encrypted-text)
  "Replace text between START and END with a button that decrypts ENCRYPTED-TEXT on click."
  (let ((button-text "[üîì Click to decrypt]"))
    (make-button
     start end
     'display button-text
     'face '(:foreground "green" :weight bold)
     'action (lambda (_)
               (my/decrypt-and-copy-to-clipboard encrypted-text))
     'follow-link t)))

You can scan the buffer for your pattern:

(defun my/replace-encrypted-patterns ()
  "Find encrypted patterns and replace them with actionable buttons."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (re-search-forward "\\[\\[encrypted:\\(.*?\\)\\]\\[.*?\\]\\]" nil t)
      (let ((start (match-beginning 0))
            (end (match-end 0))
            (encrypted-text (match-string 1)))
        (my/add-encrypted-button start end encrypted-text)))))

Run M-x my/replace-encrypted-patterns in any buffer to transform all encrypted patterns into clickable buttons.
‚úÖ Summary:

‚úÖ It is fully possible to replace fixed patterns with actionable buttons in Emacs:

    In Org-mode: using org-link-set-parameters, clickable with C-c C-o.

    In any mode: using make-button overlays to transform patterns into clickable actions.

‚úÖ You can visually replace [HERE ENCRYPTION ARMOR TEXT] with [üîì Click to decrypt] that:

    decrypts the data,

    copies to clipboard,

    displays a minibuffer confirmation.

‚úÖ This is lightweight, extensible, and scriptable, fully within Emacs, without needing external packages.
‚ö° If you wish:

‚úÖ I can provide:

    PGP/GPG decryption integration for this workflow,

    Org Babel integration to auto-decrypt inline blocks,

    Auto-trigger on file open using hooks,

    Display decrypted content inline or in *Messages* for ephemeral reading.

Let me know if you want these next to build a seamless secure reading workflow inside Emacs.
