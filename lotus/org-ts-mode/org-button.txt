Here is a clear, technical, Emacs-focused breakdown:
üöÄ Is it possible?

‚úÖ Yes, in Emacs Org-mode or any major mode, you can render a fixed pattern of text (e.g., encrypted text) as an actionable button that:

    visually replaces the text with a clickable button,

    on click, decrypts the data,

    copies the decrypted text to the clipboard.

You can achieve this using:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Org-mode link parameters (org-add-link-type) for Org mode.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Text property overlays with insert-button or make-button for any major mode.
ü©∂ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using Org-mode (org-add-link-type)
Example:

You can define a custom encrypted: link type:

(defun my/decrypt-and-copy-to-clipboard (encrypted-text)
  "Decrypt ENCRYPTED-TEXT and copy the result to the clipboard."
  (let ((decrypted-text
         ;; Replace this with your real decryption call
         (concat "[DECRYPTED] " encrypted-text)))
    (kill-new decrypted-text)
    (message "Decrypted text copied to clipboard.")))

(org-link-set-parameters
 "encrypted"
 :follow (lambda (path)
           (my/decrypt-and-copy-to-clipboard path))
 :display 'full)

Usage in Org file:

[[encrypted:U2FsdGVkX1+somethingencrypted][Click to decrypt]]

‚úÖ On pressing C-c C-o or clicking, it will:

    decrypt U2FsdGVkX1+somethingencrypted,

    copy the plaintext to your clipboard,

    show a confirmation in the minibuffer.

üö© If you want the display text to be replaced automatically in the Org buffer

Org-mode does not auto-replace link text with a button appearance by default.
For advanced rendering (like Spacemacs dashboard buttons), you can use:

    Org Babel with inline image replacement, or

    org-fontify overlays, or

    Using org-link-set-parameters :display with a custom function (Emacs 29+).

Example for visual replacement:

(org-link-set-parameters
 "encrypted"
 :display (lambda (path desc)
            (propertize (or desc "[üîí Encrypted: Click to Decrypt]")
                        'face '(:foreground "orange" :weight bold))))

ü©∂ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using overlays/buttons in any major mode

If you want this outside Org-mode (e.g., in text-mode, prog-mode, or a custom major mode), you can use:
Example:

(defun my/add-encrypted-button (start end encrypted-text)
  "Replace text between START and END with a button that decrypts ENCRYPTED-TEXT on click."
  (let ((button-text "[üîì Click to decrypt]"))
    (make-button
     start end
     'display button-text
     'face '(:foreground "green" :weight bold)
     'action (lambda (_)
               (my/decrypt-and-copy-to-clipboard encrypted-text))
     'follow-link t)))

You can scan the buffer for your pattern:

(defun my/replace-encrypted-patterns ()
  "Find encrypted patterns and replace them with actionable buttons."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (re-search-forward "\\[\\[encrypted:\\(.*?\\)\\]\\[.*?\\]\\]" nil t)
      (let ((start (match-beginning 0))
            (end (match-end 0))
            (encrypted-text (match-string 1)))
        (my/add-encrypted-button start end encrypted-text)))))

Run M-x my/replace-encrypted-patterns in any buffer to transform all encrypted patterns into clickable buttons.
‚úÖ Summary:

‚úÖ It is fully possible to replace fixed patterns with actionable buttons in Emacs:

    In Org-mode: using org-link-set-parameters, clickable with C-c C-o.

    In any mode: using make-button overlays to transform patterns into clickable actions.

‚úÖ You can visually replace [HERE ENCRYPTION ARMOR TEXT] with [üîì Click to decrypt] that:

    decrypts the data,

    copies to clipboard,

    displays a minibuffer confirmation.

‚úÖ This is lightweight, extensible, and scriptable, fully within Emacs, without needing external packages.
‚ö° If you wish:

‚úÖ I can provide:

    PGP/GPG decryption integration for this workflow,

    Org Babel integration to auto-decrypt inline blocks,

    Auto-trigger on file open using hooks,

    Display decrypted content inline or in *Messages* for ephemeral reading.

Let me know if you want these next to build a seamless secure reading workflow inside Emacs.

Here is a clear, practical analysis:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Is it possible?

‚úÖ Yes, in Emacs (Org Mode or any major mode), you can:

    Render specific text patterns as buttons.

    Attach actions (like decrypting + copying to clipboard) on click.

    Display the button in place of the original text while retaining the original buffer text.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Approaches
üÖ∞Ô∏è Using button-lock (or button-at, make-text-button)

You can scan for your pattern:

[[encrypted][HERE ENCRYPTION ARMOR TEXT]]

and replace it visually with a button overlay.

    Use regex to find pattern.

    Create a button overlay at that region.

    On click, run:

        Decrypt text (your decryption function).

        Copy to clipboard (kill-new).

üÖ±Ô∏è Using Org Mode link customization

Org already renders [[desc][link]] as clickable links.
You can define a custom Org link type, e.g., encrypted:ARMORTEXT, and define:

    A :follow function that decrypts and copies to clipboard.

    A :export function if you want to export it cleanly.

Example:

(org-link-set-parameters "encrypted"
 :follow (lambda (path)
           (let ((decrypted (my-decrypt-function path)))
             (kill-new decrypted)
             (message "Decrypted text copied to clipboard.")))
 :face '(:foreground "orange" :weight bold))

Then in your Org file:

[[encrypted:ARMORTEXT][Click to copy decrypted text]]

This will show as a link. Clicking it:
‚úÖ Decrypts.
‚úÖ Copies to clipboard.
üÖ≤Ô∏è Using display text property for fully replacing with a button label

If you want to hide the entire armor in view and show only a button label, you can:

    Use an overlay with display property.

    Show "[Decrypt]" or an icon/button instead of the full text.

    On click, run your decryption logic.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Example Minimal Implementation (Org + Overlay)

(defun my-make-encryption-button ()
  "Replace [[encrypted][ARMOR]] with button that copies decrypted text."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (re-search-forward "\\[\\[encrypted\\]\\[\\(.*?\\)\\]\\]" nil t)
      (let* ((armor-text (match-string 1))
             (start (match-beginning 0))
             (end (match-end 0)))
        (let ((button (make-button
                       start end
                       'action (lambda (_)
                                 (let ((decrypted (my-decrypt-function armor-text)))
                                   (kill-new decrypted)
                                   (message "Decrypted text copied to clipboard.")))
                       'follow-link t)))
          (button-put button 'display "[Decrypt]"))))))

(defun my-decrypt-function (armor)
  "Stub for your decryption logic."
  (concat "DECRYPTED(" armor ")"))

Usage:

    Run M-x my-make-encryption-button in your Org buffer.

    It will replace the matched pattern with [Decrypt] buttons.

    Clicking copies the decrypted content to clipboard.

üö© Summary

‚úÖ Yes, fully possible in Emacs.
‚úÖ You can visually replace the text with a clickable button.
‚úÖ On click, decrypt + copy to clipboard.
‚úÖ Best methods:

    Custom Org link type if you want native Org integration.

    Overlays/buttons if you want fully hidden display.

If you want, I can prepare:
‚úÖ A ready-to-load Emacs snippet for your config to auto-scan and render these buttons on Org file open.
‚úÖ A Guix/Emacs package approach if you want it modular for personal workflows.

Let me know if you want these next.
