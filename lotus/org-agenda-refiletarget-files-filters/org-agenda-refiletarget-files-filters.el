;; The code above will set your "default" agenda files to all files
;; ending in ".org" and ".ref" in the directories "~/org/"
;; and "~/work/". You can change these values by setting the
;; variables my-org-agenda-extensions and my-org-agenda-directories.
;; The function my-org-agenda-files-by-filetag uses these two
;; variables to determine which files to search for filetags (i.e.,
;; the larger set from which the subset will be drawn).

;; You can also easily use my-org-list-files to "mix and match"
;; directories and extensions to generate different lists of agenda
;; files. Restrict org-agenda-files by filetag

;;     Matt Lundin

;; It is often helpful to limit yourself to a subset of your agenda files. For
;; instance, at work, you might want to see only files related to work (e.g.,
;; bugs, clientA, projectxyz, etc.). The FAQ has helpful information on
;; filtering tasks using filetags and custom agenda commands. These solutions,
;; however, require reapplying a filter each time you call the agenda or writing
;; several new custom agenda commands for each context. Another solution is to
;; use directories for different types of tasks and to change your agenda files
;; with a function that sets org-agenda-files to the appropriate directory. But
;; this relies on hard and static boundaries between files.

;; The following functions allow for a more dynamic approach to selecting a subset of files based on filetags:

(defun my-org-agenda-restrict-files-by-filetag (&optional tag)
  "Restrict org agenda files only to those containing filetag."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((tagslist (my-org-get-all-filetags))
         (ftag (or tag
                   (completing-read "Tag: "
                                    (mapcar 'car tagslist)))))
    (org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock 'noupdate)
    (put 'org-agenda-files 'org-restrict (cl-rest (assoc ftag tagslist)))
    (setq org-agenda-overriding-restriction 'files)))

(defun my-org-get-all-filetags ()
  "Get list of filetags from all default org-files."
  (let ((files org-agenda-files)
        tagslist x)
    (save-window-excursion
      (while (setq x (pop files))
        (set-buffer (find-file-noselect x))
        (mapc
         (lambda (y)
           (let ((tagfiles (assoc y tagslist)))
             (if tagfiles
                 (setcdr tagfiles (cons x (cl-rest tagfiles)))
               (add-to-list 'tagslist (list y x)))))
         (my-org-get-filetags)))
      tagslist)))

(defun my-org-get-filetags ()
  "Get list of filetags for current buffer"
  (let ((ftags org-file-tags)
        x)
    (mapcar
     (lambda (x)
       (org-substring-no-properties x))
     ftags)))

;; Calling my-org-agenda-restrict-files-by-filetag results in a prompt with all
;; filetags in your "normal" agenda files. When you select a tag,
;; org-agenda-files will be restricted to only those files containing the
;; filetag. To release the restriction, type C-c C-x >
;; (org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock).
