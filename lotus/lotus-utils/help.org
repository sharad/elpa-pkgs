* Save Cursor Position

[[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_cursor_position.html][Save Cursor Position]]

When moving cursor, you often want to preserve user's original cursor position, so the cursor won't end up somewhere unexpected when your command finished.

Use save-excursion to save {point, mark, current buffer}:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; preserve {point, mark, current buffer}
(save-excursion
  ;; lisp code here involving moving cursor, mark, changing buffer.
)

#+END_SRC

Use save-restriction to save user's narrow-to-region or narrowing by your code:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; preserve user's narrow-to-region
;; useful when you want to narrow-to-region in your code to work in just that region
(save-restriction
  (narrow-to-region pos1 pos2)
  ;; lisp code here
)

#+END_SRC
